# traffic-violation-dataset

This datadset conatins traffic related violation.

In this dataset, we aim to predict the stop outcomes of a violation based on violation types. 

**Understanding Supervised Learning:** Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data to predict an outcome. In this case, we can find the stop outcomes. Initially, I considered this dataset for supervised learning (classification) applications, particularly for finding the stop_outcomes.

**Dataset Description**
1. stop_date - date of violation happen
2. stop_Time - the exact time of violation happen
3. Country_name - which country the vioaltin happen
4. driver_gender - the gender of the driver who made that violation
5. driver_age_raw - the year of driver birth
6. driver_age - the age of the driver
7. driver_race - that mean racial, whether the driver is asia, whilte or black
8. violation_raw - that mean Category of violation like Speeding - Moving Violation (Reckless Driving, Hit and run, Assaulting another
9. violation - the exact violation
10. search_conducted -  Indicates whether a search was conducted during the traffic stop. It is a binary variable, where "True" means a search was performed, and "False" means no search was conducted.
11. search_type - 
12. stop_outcome - Target column
13. is_arrested - that driver who involved in violence are arrested or not
14. stop_duration - duartaion of violation
15. drugs_related_stop - it is drugs related vilotaion. If driver involves any drug related issues.

**Objective**
Our aims to find stop_outcomes.
