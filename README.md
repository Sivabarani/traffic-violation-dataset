# traffic-violation-dataset

This datadset conatins traffic related violation.

In this dataset, we aim to predict the stop outcomes of a violation based on violation types. 

**Understanding Supervised Learning:** Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data to predict an outcome. In this case, we can find the stop outcomes. Initially, I considered this dataset for supervised learning (classification) applications, particularly for finding the stop_outcomes.
