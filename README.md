# Traffic Violation dataset
This dataset contains traffic-related violation records.
The goal of this dataset is to predict the stop outcomes of a violation based on various violation types and other features.

**Understanding Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data to predict an outcome. In this case, we aim to predict the stop_outcome based on features such as violation type, driver characteristics, and other factors. The stop_outcome is our target variable, making this a supervised classification problem.

**Dataset Description**
1. stop_date: The date the violation occurred.
2. stop_time: The exact time the violation occurred.
3. country_name: The country where the violation took place.
4. driver_gender: The gender of the driver who committed the violation (Male or Female).
5. driver_age_raw: The birth year of the driver.
6. driver_age: The age of the driver at the time of the stop.
7. driver_race: The race/ethnicity of the driver (e.g., Asian, White, Black, etc.).
8. violation_raw: The raw category of the violation (e.g., Speeding, Moving Violation, etc.).
9. violation: The exact type of violation (e.g., Speeding, Reckless Driving, Hit and Run).
10. search_conducted: Indicates whether a search was conducted during the traffic stop. This is a binary variable where "True" means a search was performed, and "False" means no search was conducted.
11. search_type: The type of search conducted.
12. stop_outcome: The result of the traffic stop (this is the target variable):
Note: Warning: The driver was given a warning but no formal citation or arrest was made.
Citation: The driver was issued a ticket or citation.
Arrest: The driver was arrested.
Other: Other outcomes, such as the stop being cleared without further action.
13. is_arrested: Whether the driver was arrested (True or False).
14. stop_duration: The duration of the violation (in minutes).
15. drugs_related_stop: Indicates whether the stop was related to drugs (True or False).

**Objective**
The primary objective of this analysis is to predict the stop_outcome based on other features. While the stop_outcome column is our main focus, we may also explore how other features, such as violation_raw, violation, and drugs_related_stop, contribute to the prediction of the stop outcome.

**Understanding Data Relationships**
**_1. Dependent Variable:_** The stop_outcome column is the target variable we aim to predict.
**_2. Independent Variables:_** Other features in the dataset, such as violation_raw, violation, drugs_related_stop, driver_age, and driver_gender, will be used to predict the stop_outcome.
